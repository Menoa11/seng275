Google Lighthouse

Name any test that passed (green), and describe what the test found in your own words (100 words max)

The only test that was green was the Accessibility test which came out to be 100%. This means that when checking
multiple different kinds of audits such as matching attributes, making sure that image elements have [alt] attributes
and as simple as making sure that elements have an accessible name came out to be successful.

Name any test that failed (yellow or red) and describe the problem in your own words (100 words max)

The test that failed with a score of 42% was the SEO section. With a score of 42 there were multiple sections that
failed but in my opinion I would say that the search is blocked by indexing is the most valuable result. This means
that Search engines can only show pages in their search results if those pages don't explicitly block indexing by search
engine crawlers. BY fixing this problem, different search engines would be able to scrape the uvic website and improve
search results for the user no matter the search engine.
