Title: Incorrect Validation of License Plate Length

Summary of bug: The `messageIsValid` method fails to correctly validate the length of license plate
messages when its not a motorcycle, as it does not properly account for the presence of 7th letter
or number without any hyphens within the string.

Expected behaviour: The method should correctly enforce the maximum character length which is 6
characters if the plate does not contain a hyphen.

Actual behaviour: The method incorrectly allows a license plate messages with more than 6 characters
without a hyphen present, violating the specified length constraint.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy the test that is listed below into SpecificationTest.java.
2. This test will fail because it is expecting the string to return false.
    ```java
    @Test
        public void testNotRightTests() {
            assertFalse(Specification.messageIsValid("ABCDEFG", false));
        }
    ```
3. Run the test and observe the failure, indicating the method incorrectly returns `true` instead
of `false` for the invalid license plate message "ABCDEFG".

Severity: Medium - This bug allows invalid license plate messages to be considered valid,
which may lead to incorrect license plate issuance and regulatory non-compliance.
